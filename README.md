front-end only POC for an appointment booking and management app

Suited for Barber Shops or Beauty Salons where multiple employees may service multiple customers at the same time

2 types of users, appointers and appointees

- appointers configure employees, shifts, breaks and appointment durations in order to create a schedule for the day
- appointees select an appointment type and then select the desired date/time from a list of available times
- appointers receive the booking as a requested appointment and assign it to an available employee or reschedule to a different day
- appointers can view the days schedule, manage the days appointments, and create appointments manually from walk-ins and telephone

libraries:
  - react-big-calendar for visualizing appointments and shifts across time spans 
  - react-data-table-component for displaying tabular data
  - zustand w/ immer for state management
  - react-hook-form for input forms
